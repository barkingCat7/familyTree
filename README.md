Family tree application written in Spring MVC, tree visualization is done using Vis.js. Validation is done using Hibernate validation 
and Spring validation. Database operations are done using Spring JDBC framework. For additional libraries MAVEN is used. As a database 
Mysql is used. To edit the database details for yours, modify the DataSource bean in DatabaseModel class. I run it with Tomcat server.
